I am sharing the exercises I am accomplishing as a part of Free Code Camp Full Stack Developer Cert Course.
This is a "Registration Form"
Languages used: HTML and CSS
Items learned:
1. HTML Boilerplate
2. Linking CSS file
3. Always use "name" attribute in each submittable element to identify elements (name simply groups the type of entries together and keeps things organized)
4. Always connect your label using "for" attribute to the input element's "id" attribute
5. Always use a "placeholder" attribute when available to let the user know about the expected input (this acts as a sample input)
